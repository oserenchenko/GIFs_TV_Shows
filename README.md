# GIFs_TV_Shows
This app displays gifs for various TV shows. When the page loads, there are 12 buttons with TV Show names on them. When a button is selected, 10 gifs from that show are displayed below. When an individual gif is selected, it is animated and when it is selected again, it stops/becomes still. There is a search from which allows the user to add more TV Shows to the list of buttons. When a show name is typed in and the submit button is selected, the show is added as a button and can then be selected to display the relative gifs. 

There are three distinct functions making the page work. 
    1. The first is a function that makes a button for each TV show listed in the TV Show Array and displays it on the page.
    2. The second function populates the gifs after a TV Show button is selected and lets the user animate and stop each gif.
    3. The third function allows for the user to add more TV Shows. This function calls on the first function to create a new button.
